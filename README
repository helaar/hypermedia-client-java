The output is the meterreading in jsonformat for meter "d6d01d193a0a4b07ac835e9c67f16b8e", on 2014-03-02. For more possible parameters, see ApiExampleDownloader.java

The basis-class is the HypermediaClient, which is a general purpose client, that has methods to click links and submit forms (i.e act as an (xhtml)-browser).
This is used by the DownloadMeterReadingClient to order a specific timeseries with readings for a meter or set of meters, depending on given parameters.
ApiExampleDownloader is just the main class, with parameter parsing and parameter defaults. It just prints out the data obtained.
Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own client.
